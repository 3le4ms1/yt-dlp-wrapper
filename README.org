#+TITLE: Wrapper script for YT-DLP
#+AUTHOR: Ismaele De Giorgi
#+DATE: <2023-08-26 sab>

Simple wrapper for [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]] written in Powershell.

Usage:
#+begin_src powershell
  $ ./script.ps1 -h | [<format> [<misc_args> ...] <media_links> ...] ...
#+end_src

The script requires [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]] and [[https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg][ffmpeg]] to be reachable through the *PATH*
environment variable to function properly.  Before doing any operation, the
script will check if the dependencies are installed and are reachable.

To download them properly on Windows, i suggest to do it via the [[https://www.scoop.sh][scoop.sh]]
package manager.  On other systems use whatever package manager is available.
